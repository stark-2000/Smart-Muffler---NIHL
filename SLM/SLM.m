function SLM

% SLM Implements a basic sound level meter.
%    SLM Uses the Data Acquisition Toolbox to estimate
%    the windowed FFT of the microphone input signal.
%    A-weighting is applied to the frequency spectrum
%    to measure sound level in dBA. Results are
%    displayed in real-time for fast/slow responses.
