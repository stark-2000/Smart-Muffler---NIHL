function runCalibration

% RUNCALIBRATION Estimates the calibration constant.
%    RUNCALIBRATION Generates several test tones to
%    verify the sound level meter implementation.
%    Several test tones are used to verify the FFT
%    display, as well as estimate the appropriate
%    calibration constant.
