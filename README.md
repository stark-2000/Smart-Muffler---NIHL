Every day, we experience sound in our environment, such as the sounds from construction & industries, mining and traffic. Normally, these sounds are at safe levels that don’t damage our hearing. But sounds can be harmful when they are too loud, even for a brief time, or when they are both loud and long-lasting. 
These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) which can be temporary as well as permanent.
NIHL is categorised based on the sound pressure level (SPL) in the dB scale.

Using MATLAB we designed an algorithm which recognises background noise and calculate its pressure level in dB. Based on a threshold limit of dB level , the signal’s pressure level will be reduced to a safer limit for human ear. It's a hardware based project.
