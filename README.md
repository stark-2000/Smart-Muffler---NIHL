## Overview:
- Every day, we experience sound in our environment, such as the sounds from construction & industries, mining and traffic. Normally, these sounds are at safe levels that don’t damage our hearing. But sounds can be harmful when they are too loud, even for a brief time, or when they are both loud and long-lasting. 
- These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) which can be temporary as well as permanent.
- NIHL is categorised based on the sound pressure level (SPL) in the dB scale.

## Solution: 
- Using MATLAB we designed an algorithm which recognises background noise and calculate its pressure level in dB. Based on a threshold limit of dB level , the signal’s pressure level will be reduced to a safer limit for human ear.
- Designed a 𝐌𝐀𝐓𝐋𝐀𝐁 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦 using multiple 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬 to detect and 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐬 above 80 dBA in real-time, enhancing speech clarity. Integrated filters for 𝐧𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 and devised a 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐦𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞𝐫 with Raspberry Pi-based data processing to prevent 𝐧𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐞-𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐬.
